                <div class="info-content">
                    <p>Floods are an overflow of water onto land that is usually dry. Inundation floods develop slowly over a period of hours or days while flash floods occur suddenly and often without warning. River floods are caused when consistent rain or snow melting forces a river to exceed capacity. Coastal floods are caused by storm surges associated with tropical cyclones and tsunamis. Floods are predicted to become more frequent and severe due to climate change.</p>

                <div class="info-content">
                    <p>Floods can occur during periods of intense rainfall, when snow melts quickly or when dams break.</p>

            <!-- What is a Flash Flood? -->
            <div class="info-section">
                <button class="info-button">What is a flash flood?</button>
                <div class="info-content">
                    <p>Flash floods are the most dangerous type of flood because they happen quickly and often without enough time for local governments and authorities to warn the community. Flash floods happen when rainfall happens too quickly for the ground to absorb, causing the water levels to rise rapidly.</p>

            <h3 class="prep-text">Talk to your family about floods.</h3>
            <p class="prep-text">Spend time together talking about floods and why they occur.</p>

            <p class="prep-text">Practice your safety plan. Find a safe evacuation route to take in the event of a flood and practice it with your family. Talk together about having a meeting point in case you get separated. Create an “emergency kit” that includes non-perishable foods, medicines, a first aid kit, flashlight and batteries, and water for several days in case you need to leave your area or services are cut off. Check with your child’s school and learn what the school’s plan is in case of a flood.</p>

            <p class="prep-text">Know your risk. Learn about the kind of flooding that can take place in your community and your local emergency contacts to reach out to for help if one occurs. Keep an eye on the forecast to be informed of any potential flooding and learn about your local alert system by researching who provides alerts, how they are broadcast, and with how much notice. It is also important to know your home’s risk level.</p>

            <p class="prep-text">Teach children to swim. The majority of deaths that occur during floods are due to drowning.</p>

            <p class="prep-text">Keep documents safe. Store any important papers like ID papers high up or in something that can protect against water damage (like a sealable plastic bag) to minimize the risk of damage.</p>
